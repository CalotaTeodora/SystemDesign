# Tech With Tim School of Programmers - System Design

## Overview

The Tech With Tim School of Programmers is in need of a new system to efficiently manage its students, professors, and courses. The system should facilitate tracking of courses offered, faculty teaching assignments, student enrollments, and grades. Additionally, it must handle personal information such as addresses, phone numbers, names, and ages for both students and professors.

## Course Management

- Each course has a minimum and maximum enrollment capacity. If the minimum enrollment is not met, the course will be canceled.
- Courses can be taught by one or more professors.
- The school needs to track grades for each student across all courses.

## Professor Details

- Professors are salaried employees, and the system must calculate their annual income.
- Professors teaching more than 4 courses in a semester receive a one-time bonus of $20,000.

## Student Classification

- Students can be local or international, and they can be full-time or part-time.
- Part-time status is defined as enrollment in 1 or 2 courses during a semester.
- The maximum course load for a student is 6 courses.

## Academic Performance

- Students receive numeric grades in the range of 0-100 for each course.
- Students with an average grade below 60% across all enrolled courses are placed on academic probation.

## System Lifecycle

- The system will be reset and updated at the end of each semester.

This design problem outlines the key requirements for the system, covering course management, professor details, student classification, and academic performance tracking. The system is expected to efficiently handle the dynamic aspects of a school semester.
