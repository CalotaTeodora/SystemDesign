# Tech With Tim School System

## Overview

The Tech With Tim School System is an educational project designed to create a system for managing the operations of the Tech With Tim School of Programmers. This project focuses on system design principles and aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for system architects and developers.

## Design Problem

The Tech With Tim School System addresses the following key requirements:

- **Course Management:** Efficiently manage course enrollments, track minimum and maximum capacities, and assign professors to courses.

- **Professor Details:** Track professors' personal information, calculate annual income, and award bonuses for teaching more than 4 courses in a semester.

- **Student Classification:** Classify students as local or international, full-time or part-time based on their enrollment status and course load.

- **Academic Performance:** Manage student grades, identify those on academic probation, and reset the system at the end of each semester.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Course Handling:** Ensure courses meet minimum enrollment requirements to prevent cancellations.

- **Professor Income Calculation:** Automatically calculate annual income for professors, including bonuses for exceeding course limits.

- **Student Enrollment Classification:** Categorize students based on enrollment status and course load.

- **Academic Performance Monitoring:** Identify students on academic probation based on average grades.

## System Lifecycle

The system undergoes a reset and update at the conclusion of each semester to prepare for the upcoming academic term.
